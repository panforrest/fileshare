**Fireshare** is a private cloud-based storage app that grew out of a desire to share files between friends.

The project is a functioning single page application that leverages a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) integration to store and serve user content safely and effectively.

- A **Node** backend with REST API. Out API handles the CRUD ops and serves endpoints in a logical, streamlined, and agnostic fashion.

- A **React** frontend with **Redux** and **React-Router**.  React ensures that the user gets the type of performant experience that is expected from modern web apps.
